It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand. I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then. The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew. <br /><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity. Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity's doctrines. During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god. Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities. This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity's teachings). This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties. Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature. Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies. Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot. Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.25,"spellLevel":1,"source":"MM pg. 342","xp":{"value":50},"class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Any one language (usually common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":2,"override":2,"max":2},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Acolyte","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.3},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Acolyte.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"items":[{"_id":"38I6bGoguRRefN6W","name":"Spellcasting","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/light/projectiles-star-purple.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>The acolyte is a 1st-level spellcaster.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 281","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false,"value":""},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV"}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/runes-star-pentagon-magenta.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.0","coreVersion":"10.279","createdTime":1661787234119,"modifiedTime":1661791116204,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}},{"_id":"bllEWfm9xfEKynhv","name":"Mind Blank","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, Divination Spells, and the Charmed condition.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"source":"MM pg. 345","xp":{"value":10},"class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Little Girl","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0}},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Commoner.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/clubs/club-simple-barbed.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.
