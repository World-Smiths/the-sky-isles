Thus, the bridge offers challenges to people attempting to cross it.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> The monks, in an effort to increase their chances of attracting the type of people they need for the incantation, added a wooden sign that reads: “Ahead lies the shining Neverdark, with beauty beyond imagination. If you can reach us, we will welcome you. Good luck.”</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>At this point, the winged leopards interact with the party one last time, as if to bid them farewell before flying away to Neverdark. If any character has managed to befriend one of the creatures, the leopard accompanies that character, circling above and seemingly cheering as that character progresses towards Neverdark. Upon reaching the bridge at mote J, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ahead of you, under the clear sky and above the white clouds, lies a bridge made of green stone blocks, floating like the rocks on which you currently stand. The bridge connects this earth mote to a massive island of green that has a tall mountain and streams. Even from this distance, you can spot buildings as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bridge is made of seven blocks of green stone of varying lengths, all 10 feet wide. Each block is separated from the next by a gap, the width of which varies. Vegetation grows on the blocks and long, thick vines descend as much as thirty feet below the bridge level.</p>\n<p>At the base of the bridge is an inscription engraved in the rock that reads: “One step at a time.” Any character who decides to spend a minute observing the bridge can attempt a DC 15 / 17 / 19 / 21 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, that character gains advantage in all checks to cross the bridge. The first time a character sets foot on the edge, Blocks 2 through 7 quickly sink, vanishing from view into the clouds.</p>\n<section class=\"ws-block note\"><img src=\"modules/the-sky-isles-module/styles/ws.svg\" width=\"48\" />\n<div class=\"contents\">\n<h3>Note from World Smiths</h3>\n<p>The Blocks have been added as <a title=\"FoundryVTT Knowledge Base article\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/tiles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tiles</a> in order to allow you to hide them when the characters arrive at the edge of the Base and then reveal them as the characters progress. You can do so by activating the Tile toolbar controls, right-clicking on the Blocks to show the Tile HUD, and then clicking on \"Toggle Visibility\".</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<h2>The Bridge</h2>\n<p>Each block behaves in a different way, and the way they work is explained below. If for any reason a character falls, allow that character to roll a DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character plummets to the ground, thousands of feet below. On a success, the character grabs a vine and can climb back to the bridge by making a successful DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Strength (Athletics) check. A failure on such a check triggers the Dexterity saving throw above, once more. A second failure results in the character falling. Each block appears in sequence when the previous block is reached, rising from the clouds at impressive speed and stopping suddenly at the bridge level. Any time one character reaches a new block, the gap they just traversed fills with fast-rising stones, which make it possible for the rest of the party to safely cross and join that character.</p>\n<section class=\"ws-block box\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Base</h3>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> N/A</p>\n<p><strong>Distance to Next Block:</strong> 10 ft.</p>\n<p>Located 10 feet away from the base of the bridge, it can be reached by any character whose Strength score is greater than 10 by simply jumping to it. A character with a Strength score less than 10 must succeed on a DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Strength (Athletics) check to make the jump with a running start; without the running start, the check is made at disadvantage.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"ws-block box\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Block 1</h3>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> 5 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance to Next Block: </strong>10 ft.</p>\n<p>Repeat the same process as from the base to Block 1.

Trust your heart. Have a little faith. All will be well.”</p>\n<p>Block 3 doesn't actually rise once Block 2 is reached. Its position is only 5 feet away from Block 2, and it will materialize under the character's feet when they are about to land.</p>\n<p>Block 2 is covered with moss, which has allowed small blue mushrooms to grow. A successful DC 13 / 14 / 15 / 16 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that these mushrooms are edible. If the result exceeds the DC by 5, the character also knows that the mushrooms have beneficial properties, and were used in the past by people who needed courage to take bold actions. There are five @Item[Emboldening Blue]s growing on this block.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"ws-block box\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Block 3</h3>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> 10 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance to Next Block:</strong> 15 ft.</p>\n<p>For characters who can't make a 15-foot jump, this block can be pulled towards Block 4 by using a rope to a small pillar that stands at the southern edge of Block 4. Lassoing the pillar requires a character to make a ranged attack against an AC of 13. On a hit, the character can pull Block 3 towards Block 4 by making a successful DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"ws-block box\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Block 4</h3>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> 25 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance to Next Block:</strong> 20 ft.</p>\n<p>The east and west edges of this block are protected by wooden parapets. A successful DC 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the top part of the parapet is tied by ropes with knots that can be unknotted. The parapets can then be disassembled and their sturdy boards can be placed between Blocks 4 and 5 to create a makeshift bridge.</p>\n<p>Crossing the board bridge requires a successful DC 12/ 13 / 14 / 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Guidelines on such failures are mentioned above under “The Bridge.” The parapet pillars are solidly fixed in the stone and can support up to 300 pounds, so the crossing character can tie a rope securely to a pillar and use it as a safety line. Once a character reaches Block 5, the impact of the rising stones filling the gap scatters the wooden boards and they are lost.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"ws-block box\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Block 5</h3>\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> 15 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance to Next Block:</strong> 30 ft.</p>\n<p>Lying on the ground is a 15-foot-long pole made of flexible bamboo.

If the person being tested is a Neverdarkan, they'll plead for one of the characters to act as their Champion in this incredible challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Location:</strong> Neverdark</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The Test of Truth was created long ago to ensure that the members of the Clan of the Phoenix would be as capable as possible to defend the people from a possible return of Sethlok. When a Neverdarkan fails, for instance, one of the tests from the Way of the Phoenix, they're treated with sympathy and are supported to grow and improve before taking the test again. Should they fail a second time, however, they're subjected to the Test of Truth. They are given the opportunity to practice for a week before this ordeal, if they wish.</p>\n<p>This trial offers a Neverdarkan a third chance to prove that they won't be a weak link if the Clan is ever challenged again. In this test, mind and body are tested. Any Neverdarkan who succeeds in meeting its challenges emerges stronger, smarter, and more prepared to face adversities. Those who fail are “embraced by the clouds and grounds below”; i.e., they die.</p>\n<p>If the party didn't hinder Threyss and he managed to bring back the Black Goat, a monk named Fayril is brought forth for the test after having been caught for a second time falling asleep on guard duty at the @JournalEntry[All-Seeing Towers]. Fayril and his wife recently had a baby and he hasn't been sleeping well because the newborn has been sick. Fearing that this sickness could be seen as a weakness, he and his wife have been trying to manage the situation themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> Threyss is subjected to the test as part of Kayden's plan.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>Regardless of who is being tested, once back from the hunt, or at any time you feel appropriate in Neverdark, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A mass of people has gathered around the Sky Grounds, and you hear the words “Test of Truth” repeated many times by the crowd. Some people look excited, while others seem concerned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the characters ask people in the crowd about the test, they can learn the information mentioned in the Background (above) about the Test of Truth.</p>\n<p>A short time later, a man, accompanied by Kayden, Aryana and Qaeth, is brought up. All four enter the Sky Grounds and Kayden addresses the public, saying loudly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My fellow brothers and sisters, I stand before you, saddened by the obligations my position requires of me. I take no pleasure in such situations, but we all know that we are only as strong as the weakest link. This man must prove his worth to the Phoenix so that his past failures can be buried in the past and he can be reborn as a new man... a strong Neverdarkan. Let the trial begin!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, the one facing the ordeal invokes the Phoenix Champion rule, which states that another person can undergo the trial on behalf of the violator, believing in the violator's potential to learn and become a strong link. If the champion fails, both the champion and the person they're defending suffer the same fate. On a success, the champion assumes responsibility for mentoring the person; should the person commit another violation, both the champion and the offender are sentenced to death. Thus far, this latter eventuality has never occurred.</p>\n<p>If Fayril is the one to be tested, he is desperate and unprepared; if it's Threyss, he is following Kayden's plan. They use the following arguments to invoke the Phoenix Rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fayril: He admits having personal issues which led him to fail his duty. He whispers the truth about his baby to the party and pleads for their help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Threyss: He claims that the reason he was unsuccessful in hunting the goat is because the party got in his way, so they should be the ones being tried.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A character can agree to become the champion or the party may decline to become involved. If the party elects not to help, the offender goes through on their own. Regardless of who is to be the Tested One, a @Actor[Phoenix Mage] approaches them with a scroll and asks them to kneel. The mage recites the words of power for about a minute, then gives them a sprig of an herb and commands that they eat it. Upon consuming this sweet herb, the person's mind is gripped by strong hallucinations and they become unaware of their surroundings. The trial has three parts: Stillness, Reflection, and Courage. The crowd can see all movements and hear the words of the person undergoing the ordeal. If the Tested One dies in their visions, they die in the real world. Under ordinary circumstances, the leaders of the Clan take the body to the edge of the earth mote and, saying a few words in honor of the deceased, throw it over. If you are following the Overarching Plot, the body is used in the incantation to summon the Yokai Phoenix.</p>\n<h3>Stillness</h3>\n<p>The goal of this trial is to assess the Tested One's behavior under pressure. The Tested One sees an unending rocky wasteland, with dark and angry skies above. A wooden sign reads: “Haste is the enemy of perfection.” A paved path leads to a dark cave 100 feet ahead with a stone archway at the entrance. Lightning strikes the ground violently, shaking it. A child appears in the cave opening, waving to the Tested One and shouting, “Come quickly! Hurry up!”</p>\n<p>Ask the Tested One to roll initiative. The lightning acts on initiative 10. If the Tested One walks instead of running (i.e., without taking the Dash action), they reach the cave safely; however, describe how close the lightning strikes each round. If they Dash, they must succeed on a DC 13/15/17/19 Dexterity saving throw or take lightning damage equal to a quarter of their maximum hit points. Upon reaching the cave, the Tested One is transported to the next phase.</p>\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\n<p>The Tested One is now in the center of a huge, empty arena. If a character has assumed the role of champion, a reflection of themselves appears before them. This reflection has the same stat block as the character. The reflection states: “You shall not prevail. I am you. I know your every thought.” Then it attacks the character.</p>\n<p>On the first turn of every round, the character must succeed on a DC 13 / 15 / 17 / 19 Wisdom saving throw or else the reflection will have the benefit of a foresight spell until the end of the character's next turn.</p>\n<p>When defeated, the reflection holds an iron key to their neck, which opens a gate in the north of the arena, transporting the character to the next stage.</p>\n<h3>Courage</h3>\n<p>The arena gates take the Tested One to a fiery wasteland with volcanos in the distance and rivers of lava nearby. Beside the Tested One are close friends; these could be monks or other members of the party. Not too far away is a massive demon guarding a purple portal. There seems to be no other way out. The companions look at the Tested One and say: “Look! The exit! Let's take down that beast and leave this place!” The goal of this test is to see if the Tested One is willing to die for their companions, fighting alongside them.</p>\n<p>They rush towards the demon, which is a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.uZ8NrRenwYZ4qNf6]{Balor}; if the character is of tier 3 or 4, the balor has double hit points and deals double damage. The only way through the portal is by sneaking past the demon while the companions fight it. However, if the character does that, the balor puts its hands through the portal and grabs the Tested One, saying with a harsh and raspy voice: “Leaving your friends for dead? You could be one of us!” It smiles before attempting to crush the Tested One. If they survive, they see their companions' bodies lying on the ground. The portal closes and they have to face the demon on their own, which will almost certainly result in the character's death. If instead, they stay and fight the demon alongside their companions, let the character fight for a round. If the character receives a blow that would be fatal, or at the start of the second round, the hallucinations end and the participant has passed the Test of Truth.</p>\n<h3>Developments</h3>\n<p>If a character has taken the NPC's place in the trial and fails, the leaders attempt to take the body to be used in the incantation to summon the Yokai Phoenix. If the party interferes, or tries to bring the character back, Kayden reminds them that they have agreed to follow the rules of the trial. If the party persists in their efforts to reclaim the body, the monks will fight the party, which is likely to result in defeat for the characters as other monks from the crowd will join the fight. If the party loses, they keep the characters unconscious but alive at the base of the mountain, near “The Way Up.” The character who died in the trial had their body consumed by the incantation.</p>\n<p>If they succeed on the trial, Kayden offers the party a ruby worth 500 / 1,000 / 1,500 / 2,000 gp and a magic item of your choosing, the rarity depending on the party's tier, as shown in the table below.</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Magic Item</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Tier of Play</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Uncommon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rare</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Very Rare</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Legendary</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> Instead of going through the Test of Truth, Kayden summons the party to the monastery and explains the situation, asking for their help in dealing with Sethlok.

The goal is to summon the Golden Phoenix and control it to help in the fight against Sethlok. Whether or not Kayden succeeds, Sethlok attacks the monks and the party can decide who they want to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Location:</strong> Fireborn Monastery</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"ws-sidebar-group\"><main>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Having been tricked into believing the famed Golden Phoenix could be of help against the bakeneko, Kayden has researched a way to bring forth the phoenix under their control. To achieve this, they must perform a powerful incantation that requires the body of a powerful sentient being to be mixed with the ashes of a volcano. This creates a huge bonfire that summons the legendary Golden Phoenix.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>All that Kayden needs is the body component. Depending on what has previously transpired, Kayden could obtain the body of one of the characters. As this is unlikely, Kayden invites the party to the monastery's courtyard and explains everything they know to the party, asking for their help.</p>\n<p>If no good candidate offers themselves as a sacrifice, Kayden sees no alternative to sacrificing themself, designating their son to assume the position of leader of the Clan once they're gone. If the party thinks of a viable alternative, Kayden eagerly embraces it.</p>\n<p>The party won't have major reasons to be suspicious of the Golden Phoenix situation, but if for any reason a party wants to dissuade Kayden from summoning the phoenix by assuring them that the party can provide the help they need, the they must succeed on a DC 20 / 22 / 24 / 26 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>\n<p>If the characters are successful in convincing Kayden to rely on them instead of summoning the mythical creature, the monk tells the party that they know Sethlok's tactics and that the yokai will surely wreak havoc in the village before getting tired enough to actually stop and fight.</p>\n</main>\n<aside class=\"ws-block sidebar\">\n<h3>The Golden Phoenix</h3>\n<p>Use this information in case any character tries to discover information about the Golden Phoenix. By making a successful DC 17 / 18 / 19 / 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character learns a piece of information below. If the result exceeds the DC, for each point of difference add one additional piece of information from the list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The fabled Golden Phoenix is said to produce a fire so hot that it can melt even stone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Golden Phoenix is a unique creature said to inhabit the depths of the Elemental Plane of Fire, its lair set in a huge gold deposit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legends tell that this creature's flames can even kill fire elementals.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What most people do not know is that the Golden Phoenix fought a powerful Demon Lord who sought to enlist the phoenix to their ranks. The demon managed to defeat the phoenix, turning it into a yokai under its control. Sethlok knows this and has used that knowledge to sow a crisis that will bring even greater chaos to the monks' home.</p>\n</aside>\n</section>\n<p>Kayden suggests that the party should try to lure Sethlok to the courtyard to give them and the other monks time to make sure that everyone is safe and secure. Kayden will regroup with the party at the courtyard once things in the village are taken care of. According to the mages' divination spells, Sethlok is to strike on the following day.</p>\n<h3>The Incantation</h3>\n<p>If the summoning incantation is used, either Kayden, or Aryana and Qaeth, will execute the rite. The monks spend the rest of the day preparing for Sethlok's coming. The party is free to do so as well.</p>\n<p>The monks explain that they can begin the incantation only after Sethlok shows itself. At this point, the monks believe that Sethlok will be drawn to the courtyard to stop the monks from summoning. Once Sethlok appears (see “Sethlok has Arrived” below) and the party arrives at the courtyard, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sky darkens as the ancient words are recited and chanted. The body of the chosen sacrifice lies in a massive brazier which is lit during the incantation. After a few moments, the ground shakes, the brazier breaks, and a gigantic flaming bird with dark feathers emerges from the ground. It emanates dark energy as it flies up to the center of the courtyard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, Sethlok (@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.eOpFXkUmD7Vpk3gS]{Tier 1}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.SapjooUgDpRuhATD]{Tier 2}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.bRdimDqcvfZFF94X]{Tier 3}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.9EQIo11PhZoeRnp3]{Tier 4}) arrives as well, laughing as it sees its plan unfold as expected. Skip to “The Fight.”</p>\n<h3>Sethlok has Arrived</h3>\n<p>If the party is in the village, read or paraphrase the following aloud, or just describe screams, fire and smoke:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The silence created by the tension and anticipation of the arrival of the dreaded yokai is broken as nearby vegetation catches fire. The fire quickly spreads, and you briefly see a four-legged figure near the flames before it vanishes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bakeneko looks for opportunities to set things on fire and teases anyone trying to fight it. If the party engages, the yokai's attention focuses on them and it tries to assess the party's power.</p>\n<p>If the party tries to lure Sethlok to the monastery, the yokai gladly takes the bait, as it's overconfident. On the way there, it starts more fires whenever possible. Some monks attempt to hit the cat with paralyzing darts, though the monks have been instructed not to waste resources or put themselves in danger trying to go after the bakeneko. Instead, they are to defend themselves and their families.</p>\n<h3>The Fight</h3>\n<p>If lured to the courtyard, the bakeneko assesses the situation and plays safe, hiding whenever possible. There, it unleashes its most powerful resources as it knows it's outnumbered and surrounded.</p>\n<p>Sethlok (@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.eOpFXkUmD7Vpk3gS]{Tier 1}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.SapjooUgDpRuhATD]{Tier 2}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.bRdimDqcvfZFF94X]{Tier 3}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.9EQIo11PhZoeRnp3]{Tier 4}) is a bakeneko with an Intelligence score of 16. While it wants to have its fun while destroying the monks' home, if the incantation didn't take place it's fighting alone, so the yokai won't risk itself too much. Sethlok attempts to set fire to as many things as it can to create a more advantageous battlefield. Its focus is on whichever foe that seems most dangerous, whether by damage or battlefield control.</p>\n<section class=\"ws-sidebar-group\"><main>\n<p>The first time the bakeneko is spotted in plain sight, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You finally spot the dreaded creature: a cat the size of a dog, with ash-encrusted black fur and gleaming eyes; it's walking its hind legs and has a smug smile on its face. It laughs, saying: “Burn, fools! BURNNNNNN!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the bakeneko is reduced to 25 percent of its hit points, it attempts to flee the scene while using the fire as cover.</p>\n<p>If the phoenix has been summoned, it fights those who summoned it. Use the yokai phoenix stat block (@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.TiIwmDuFKOUwId82]{Tier 1}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.TspR9URH8RKGe8Ce]{Tier 2}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.InZju0pK08iqjyPU]{Tier 3}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.APOxbJ6L3l4FG4Vv]{Tier 4}). At this point, Sethlok lets the phoenix cause chaos while it uses its Pyrokinesis to spread fire around the battlefield; it uses no other action or legendary action unless provoked. The phoenix uses its Fiery Hurricane whenever possible, oftentimes choosing to recharge it with Refuel. The phoenix fights until killed; if that occurs, Sethlok flees.</p>\n</main>\n<aside class=\"ws-block sidebar\" style=\"flex:2\">\n<h3>Neko Yokais</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Neko Yokais, the bakeneko included, are creatures from Japanese folklore and they were first introduced to 5e by 2C Gaming through the <a href=\"https://store.2cgaming.com/products/total-party-kill-bestiary-pdf\">Total Party Kill Bestiary Vol 1</a>.

Perched atop these floating rocks are beautiful winged leopards, who watch the party and act as if they want to play with the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Location:</strong> Anywhere near the top of a mountain.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The earth motes that lead to the Sky Isles are usually hidden from sight by thick clouds, only becoming visible on rare occasions when strong winds blow the clouds away. The Phoenix Monks raise the winged leopards to be their mounts but allow them a lot of freedom to roam around. The leopards love exploring and playing in various places on these earth motes. If they spot people, they'll want to interact and play catch with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> Alternatively, the beasts have been instructed to attract possible travelers to Neverdark, as Kayden assumes that whoever manages to reach the Sky Isles should be great candidates for a role in the incantation.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>When the party is up in the mountains, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The clouds that surrounded the peak you've climbed are blown away by a strong wind, revealing several flying rocks covered with lush vegetation. A flock of birds takes off from one of them and on another you notice a couple of large, winged leopards, their yellow fur shining in the sunlight. They are staring at you, and they wave their tails up once, pause, and start waving them up and down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A successful DC 11 / 13 / 15 / 17 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that this tail-waving usually means that a feline is happy. Below are some checks the party may want to make when faced with this situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A successful DC 13 / 15 / 17 / 19 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a character to notice that the earth motes are connected by thick ropes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A successful DC 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check allows a character to gain the winged leopard's trust, allowing them to get close enough to touch the beast before it flies away (see below).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The creatures stick around until the party approaches them. If they don't, the winged leopards fly toward the party, whistling happily and acting as if they want to play. After a few attempts to interact, the winged leopards fly into the clouds among the earth motes. A successful DC 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that it's unusual that the beasts flew up, as they're already at the top of the mountain.</p>\n<p>Since the winged leopard is a monstrosity, any beast-related spell such as animal friendship will fail. Attempting to communicate with them is difficult, although certain characters may realize that these creatures seem to be in a playful mood.</p>\n<h2>The Chase</h2>\n<p>Assuming that the creatures piqued the party's interest, the winged leopards allow the party to get close and then fly away while making whistling sounds and wagging their tails. Anytime the party is lagging behind, they'll land on a rock and patiently wait for them, waving their tails up and down.</p>\n<p>Navigating the earth motes is not an easy task, but the Phoenix Monks have made this easier by setting up rope paths which greatly help. Ascending the ropes takes the form of a skill challenge. Each character must take one action on their turn, describing how they want to contribute to the group's success in this effort.</p>\n<div class=\"ws-block skill-challenge\">\n<p><strong> Success:</strong> The party reaches the top earth mote marked a J on the map, which is the one that leads to Neverdark (see “The Skywalk”).</p>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Succeeding four times in their group checks before failing three times.

The platform on the southwest corner is the mountaintop and is considered ground zero for height calculation purposes.

Without flying, there are two main ways to traverse from one mote to another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Climb ropes (cr): while these could potentially help save time, some of the ropes are set in dangerous locations, where a mistake could mean a fatal fall. Climbing such ropes is also more difficult. Climbing such ropes requires a successful DC 15 / 17 / 19 / 21 Athletics check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Suspended ropes (sr): these ropes are tied around tree trunks, or in some occasions, fixed by a small wooden pillar. Using these ropes to cross from one earth mote to another is slightly easier, requiring a successful DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Athletics check.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In case of a failure, allow a character to roll a DC 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 Dexterity saving throw.

{"_id":"jwZDYMMvKHY0YNCZ","name":"The Sky Isles","content":"<h1>The Sky Isles</h1>\n<section class=\"ws-block highlight\">\n<p><strong>Recommended Tier:</strong> 3</p>\n</section>\n<p>Few have ever seen the earth motes that make up the Sky Isles thousands of feet above the ground, but those fortunate ones will never forget the sight. Reaching this amazingly beautiful place is a challenge; a visitor must climb the tallest mountain and from there, make their way upward from one floating rock to another. Shining white clouds mostly obscure the land beneath the Isles, although a few openings allow stray sunbeams to reach the earth. The largest earth mote is home to the little village of Neverdark; surrounded by luminous clouds and other smaller earth motes, Neverdark is constantly illuminated. Brilliant sunlight streams through the crystal clear skies above the Isles by day, and at night moonlight and starshine bathe them in soft radiance.</p>\n<h2>Secular Seclusion</h2>\n<p>Centuries ago, a small group of monks was looking to restart their lives after having had their monastery burned down by a bakeneko. Resembling black cats, bakenekos are sadistic neko yokais—cat demons—who are especially fond of arson. Many monks tried to fight the fiendish, ash-covered cat to no avail. Many perished in the attempt, and their place of meditation and training—made primarily of wood—quickly succumbed to the vile powers of the bakeneko, who laughed while sowing chaos.</p>\n<p>The survivors traveled far away from their homes with the goal of rebuilding. Having climbed to the top of the highest mountain they could find, they found that there was still a way to the skies—quite literally. Following this path took them to the bright floating isles touching the crystal clear skies. There, they settled, using as much stone and metal as possible for building materials instead of wood.</p>\n<p>They created the Way of the Phoenix as part of the Clan of the Phoenix so they could be prepared if any similar evil would find them again. The training is brutal, involving being subjected to fire and resisting as long as possible. With time, the Phoenix Monks, as they called themselves, perfected the practice, learning not only to resist the fire's power but to turn it to their advantage.</p>\n<h2>Neverdark</h2>\n<p>Under the extreme dedication and discipline of the Phoenix Monks, Neverdark prospered. Their new home being unknown to most of the rest of the world surely helped. On rare occasions, the monks received visitors skillful enough to reach the Sky Isles. A few of these travelers wanted to stay and live there, which the monks didn't object to as long as the newcomers followed their rules and way of life.</p>\n<p>The monks live and work on rice plantations as well as growing other types of vegetables and fruits. Game is rare, with only the occasional mountain goat reaching the Isles, so they rely on trout and eggs for their protein intake. The rocky cliffs that hug the village are rich in quality stone and ore. Most trees have been felled and used to make small kitchen utensils such as bowls and plates.</p>\n<section class=\"ws-sidebar-group\"><main>\n<p>Few things threaten the village; only a single attack has occurred since the bakeneko tragedy. Around a decade ago, a blue dragon hunting for the rare winged leopards that inhabit these lands tracked one to the monks' home. The dragon tried to negotiate the monks' lives in exchange for the beasts, which resulted in a ferocious confrontation. Mounted on the very beasts the dragon wished to eat, the Phoenix Monks triumphed; a sanctuary around the dragon's bones commemorates the day they stood strong for their home.</p>\n<h2>Strong Values</h2>\n<p>“The strong shall respect life with unending serenity.” Because of what the founders went through in the past, Phoenix Monks made sure to pass on their history and values from generation to generation. This created a small society with strong ties, its members respecting and valuing each other. The rare acts of disrespect are severely punished by leaving the offender tied by their feet upside down, pointing at the clouds below the floating island.</p>\n<p>Calm and patience are cultivated and are qualities that most monks possess and pride themselves on. They learn to hold anger, hatred, and fear in check, only to be released during a life or death fight, which makes them fearsome combatants.</p>\n<p>Because of their past failure, they strive for success, which makes most of them intolerant to weakness and mistakes. Everyone is allowed to make grave mistakes…once. Further failures and errors will result in the monk in question being subjected to the Test of Truth. The price of failure is death, as Neverdark has no room for weaklings.</p>\n</main>\n<aside class=\"ws-block sidebar\">\n<h3>Isolated Location</h3>\n<p class=\"ws-contents\">Unlike most of the other locations presented in this supplement, the Sky Isles are difficult to randomly come across. Because of this, the first three encounters are connected and linked, assuming that a party will find it precisely by chance. There are other ways to plug this location into your game:</p>\n<p>The party hears about the winged leopards and learns that they can be found in the Sky Isles.</p>\n<p>A Tier3/Tier4 party with flying resources could spot some shadows in the clouds or see the winged leopards flying towards the shadow. As a twist, similar to @JournalEntry[The Way Up] encounter, the beasts could be under attack.</p>\n<p>It can be used to enrich a monk's backstory, having been the character's training grounds.</p>\n<p>The characters are preparing to face a powerful, fire-related foe and hear that the Phoenix Monks have mastered enduring burns, some even being able to control flames. Passing @JournalEntry[The Test of Truth] could grant them the @Item[Fiery Blessing].</p>\n</aside>\n</section>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"F0kLzvTSBVFNjohJ":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.AY69yWDajdQu2KMK"},"cf":{"id":"temp_izqv1itu6lk","path":"The Sky Isles","color":"#000000"}}}

Remembering the pleasure it experienced in the devastation, the fiend decided to find the monks again. Using its fiendish ties, it didn't take the neko yokai long to learn the monks' location.</p>\n<p>Even with all its power, the bakeneko struggled to reach the Sky Isles to reconnoiter. Having finally reached its destination, Sethlok carefully spied on the monks, noting with amusement the ways in which the monks had adapted their way of life since the last time the bakeneko met them. Thrilled by the added challenge, the cat started crafting a plan to be the harbinger of chaos once more.</p>\n<p>Sethlok, smarter than other creatures of its kind, intends to trick the Phoenix Monks into bringing about their own demise. By calling in favors earned over its long life, the yokai planted false information that convinced the monks that their ancient enemy had grown stronger and had located the monks' new home. The second part of the plot involves deceiving the monks into believing that the Yokai Phoenix, a fabulous creature from an old myth, could help them against the upcoming threat from the bakeneko. Ancient legends tell that this legendary being has the power to generate a fire so intense that it can defeat ancient red dragons and fire elementals, and even melt stone. The monks would think the phoenix would be the perfect means to end a bakeneko's life.</p>\n<p>However, what the monks don't know—but Sethlok does—is that the Yokai Phoenix has become corrupted, turning into a yokai itself, becoming a yokai phoenix. The bakeneko can already gleefully picture the monks' desperation at the sight of their home being reduced to ashes once more.</p>\n<p>Kayden, the leader of the Phoenix Monks, is determined to stop Sethlok this time, resorting to desperate measures to ensure that their home will not fall again.</p>\n<h2>Encounters Overview</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Name</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Way Up]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Playful @Actor[Winged Leopard]s perched atop earth motes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A mountain top</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Skywalk]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bridge that takes people to Neverdark</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Earth motes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[A Sight for Sore Eyes]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Welcome to Neverdark!</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat / Social</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neverdark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Show Some Respect]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A peaceful shrine, but not quite</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat / Social</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neverdark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Hunt]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The black goat is spotted and hunted</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat / Social</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neverdark/Earth motes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Test of Truth]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No room for weaknesses</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exploration / Combat / Social</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neverdark</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Fiery Incantation]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>An act of desperation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Combat / Social</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neverdark/Fireborn Monastery</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>The Way Up.</strong> While at the top of a mountain, the party comes across flying earth motes with a few winged leopards eating berries from bushes growing on one of them.

Stories recorded by the monks' ancestors tell of the delicious taste of the meat of the black goats. This creature has been spotted once in recent years and Threyss, Kayden's son, attempted to hunt it down but failed. One of the children has just spotted it again and word quickly spread through Neverdark.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>Soon everyone has heard of the appearance of the Black Goat @Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.MpUaj58mke2koKBp]{Tier 1}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.7WM8YzuL1NmZCmMu]{Tier 2}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.V8VWZWKB5dLDQQxh]{Tier 3}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.HvV6KlxHwiIauoC5]{Tier 4}, and Threyss promises the community that this time he'll bring it back to Neverdark for a feast where everyone can taste this rare delicacy. If the characters are present when Threyss addresses the Neverdarkans at the fair, he invites them to tag along. He insists that he doesn't need their help but that it's a good opportunity for them to get to know more about the isles and also for him to get to know them better. He also mentions that there could be some @Item[Emboldening Blue] mushrooms there.</p>\n<p>According to the children, the beast has been spotted north of the village, on the biggest earth mote after the one Neverdark was built on. To reach that place, they need to traverse through some smaller motes, similar to @JournalEntry[The Way Up] encounter, but the earth motes on this side have rope bridges that the monks have built.</p>\n<p>During their way there, Threyss asks questions about who they are, why they are there, how things are at the ground level, etc. If the party asks him what he knows about the goat, he can tell the party only a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The black goat is really fast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It can vanish from view and jump long and high distances.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Its senses must be extremely sharp, as it's difficult to surprise it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legends say its meat is delicious beyond belief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once they reach the proper mote, he slows his pace and grabs his bow, signaling for you to stay behind him. He starts looking for tracks, carefully scanning the wilderness ahead to try to spot the creature. He walks forward very slowly.</p>\n<p>Any character can decide to help, though Threyss becomes angry when he realizes that the party is taking action that could potentially interfere with his hunt. He informs them that they're on their own and that he's going to find the creature before the party does. Threyss is a @Actor[Phoenix Firepalm] with the following changes to his stat block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>His Wisdom score is 16</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He has a +6 bonus to the Survival skill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>His bonus to the Animal Handling and Perception skills is +6</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He wields a longbow and has one paralyzing arrow, gaining the @Item[Paralyzing Longbow] attack</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Kayden learns that he took a paralyzing arrow to hunt a goat, Threyss will probably be faced with @JournalEntry[The Test of Truth], but he's counting on no one finding that out.</p>\n<p>Finding the Black Goat @Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.MpUaj58mke2koKBp]{Tier 1}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.7WM8YzuL1NmZCmMu]{Tier 2}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.V8VWZWKB5dLDQQxh]{Tier 3}/@Compendium[the-sky-isles-module.actors.HvV6KlxHwiIauoC5]{Tier 4} (see below) requires two successful DC 15 / 17 / 19 / 21 Wisdom (Survival) checks. If the party achieves two success before Threyss does, on the second success, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After following goat tracks bigger than the ordinary, you finally spot a large goat with black fur and horns. It's atop a tall rock eating apples from a tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, if the party doesn't immediately hide, the goat spots the characters.

If the party isn't willing to climb up, the boy also mentions that there are some rare flowers up there, and while they aren't to be harvested in quantity, no one will notice if they take one each. Since people are generally not allowed to go up there, Cassel prefers to ascend through less-frequently used routes instead of taking the stairs.</p>\n<p>If the party agrees to follow Cassel, he'll lead the way and climb to the top via the fastest route possible, which he's already very used to. To make things simpler, ask for an Athletics group check for each of the three platforms. A success means that the party reaches the next level, be it the next platform or the top. A failure means that the party struggled to reach the next level, each character taking bludgeoning damage from multiple falls equal to [[2d6]] / [[3d6]] / [[6d6]] / [[8d6]]. The DCs for each platform are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First platform: DC 12 / 14 / 16 / 18</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Central platform: DC 13 / 15 / 17 / 19</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Top: DC 13 / 16 / 19 / 22</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Three watchtowers on the top platform complicate the ascent; besides climbing, the party must avoid being caught. Cassel warns the characters about this and takes the stealthier way. If the party doesn't take precautions to avoid notice or if they are spotted while trying to sneak up, the guards call the party to approach the tower. Cassel, knowing this is his fault, surrenders and defends the group, saying that he tricked them into going up. If a fight occurs, Cassel begs the party to stop and surrender.</p>\n<p>Succeeding in a group Stealth check is enough for the party to reach the base of the tower located at the top, which allows them to avoid the notice of the watchtower guards. The monks stationed at the towers are more watching the skies, not the ground. Cassel is right; the view is beautiful. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You feel literally at the top of the world. The brilliant, crystal clear sky above you, small earth motes floating past over white clouds that look like wool... you revel in the feel of the soft grass beneath your feet. As pleasant as it is to walk atop this hill, you know that venturing too far from the tower's base could reveal your position. A few feet ahead of you are bright red flowers which deliver a tantalizing scent to your nostrils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The flowers are called invigorating flowers. A flower can live up to 24 hours once harvested unless it's placed in a vase filled with water, in which case they live for one week.

{"_id":"x8FBbnfelwDx1Rvq","name":"Show Some Respect","content":"<h1>Show Some Respect</h1>\n<section class=\"ws-block highlight\">\n<p><strong>Encounter Type: </strong>Social/Exploration/Combat</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Overview</strong>: While the party is visiting this gorgeous shrine, having the opportunity to interact with an NPC, one of the Neverdarkans is taken there to be punished for an infraction. The party can watch the scene or try to intervene.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Location: </strong>Neverdark</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Considered a place for more solitary meditation as it's much less crowded than the @JournalEntry[Meditation Court], the Refreshing Shrine is equally attractive for the cooling spray from the waterfall. When the party arrives, they find only a single monk there, praying in silence. But a commotion shatters the tranquil scene when a Neverdarkan is brought to the shrine to receive the punishment reserved for those who disrespect the Clan's values.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> If the party climbed the @JournalEntry[Shading Hill] with Cassel and avoided detection, Kayden asks one of the monks, Yeghel, to help them with a situation to lure the party into making a mistake. Yeghel, eager to help the tribe but not completely thrilled about the plan itself, goes to a public place and starts a discussion—which quickly escalates—with an elderly monk, to force a situation in which people will witness Yeghel's disrespect. Once he is tied upside down, if the party takes the bait, Yeghel will plead for help.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>The Refreshing Shrine is an open cave within the @JournalEntry[Shading Hill], a hollow cylinder with no roof or solid ground, surrounded by waterfalls. In the center is a small earth mote with a shining shrine built atop it, which can be reached by traversing floating tiles.</p>\n<p>If a creature rests for 10 minutes within the shrine and comes in contact with the mist from the waterfall, they regain [[1d4]] / [[2d4]] / [[3d4]] / [[4d4]] hit points and are cured of the poisoned condition and any of its effects</p>\n<p>The main hooks to trigger this encounter, which requires the party to be in the secluded shrine, are listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The characters hear about the special properties of the Refreshing Shrine and may decide to investigate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sometimes winged leopards like to fly through the waterfalls and the party may spot a trio of the creatures teasing each other while flying towards the hill. Once they see the characters, they'll tease them instead, and then fly toward the shrine as if to lead them there. Once the party arrives, the leopards fly up and out of sight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The party hears the news that someone violated the Clan's rules and that proper punishment will be meted out.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If hooks 1 or 2 are used, read or paraphrase the following once the party reaches the shrine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon after entering, you spot a small, white gazebo built atop a tiny earth mote which can be reached by stepping across floating stone tiles. Surrounding this gazebo are many waterfalls, their sound acting as a calming white noise. You see a person kneeling in the center of the gazebo, with their back toward you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The person praying is a Neverdarkan named Layssa, and meeting her can go one of two ways:</p>\n<p><strong>Standalone Encounter:</strong> She's praying to their god, thankful for the prosperity of their community. If interrupted, she's surprised but happy to finally see the visitors that her people have been talking about. She happily chats with the characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> If following this plotline, she's praying for forgiveness as she's not proud of what Kayden has asked their people to do with the visitors. In this situation, if interrupted, she seems wary and nervous, but she'll never betray the Clan. Instead, she tells the characters a half-truth, mentioning the rumors of Sethlok's return.</p>\n<p>If hooks 1 or 2 were used, after a brief roleplay with Layssa, a group of monks arrive carrying the offender; if hook 3 was used, skip the interaction with Layssa and proceed with the encounter. This person to be punished could either be Cassel if they were spotted during @JournalEntry[The Top of the World] encounter under @JournalEntry[A Sight for Sore Eyes], or it could be Yeghel. If anyone is meditating in the shrine, the monks ask for them to leave, and take the offender to the center of the shrine. One of the monks states that the offender has failed to live up to the Clan's standard, having committed an act of profound disrespect, and gives a rough outline of the offense (either climbing the forbidden hill or disrespecting the elderly).</p>\n<p>The monks proceed to grab one of the chains affixed to the edge of the central mote, tying it to the offender's feet. The prisoner is gagged, then the monks throw him over the edge, where he remains suspended upside down for a day.</p>\n<p>If the party tries to intervene, they are warned once to stand back. If the party persists, the monks attack unless one of the characters offers to take the offender's place.

Upon arriving, the characters are welcomed by the leader Kayden, who states that they can only stay if they agree to their rules: “The strong shall respect life with unending serenity.”</p>\n<p><strong>Encounter Location:</strong> Neverdark</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The Phoenix Monks are excellent hosts to the worthy guests who can reach their secluded home. As long as the party agrees to follow the monks' rules, they are welcome in Neverdark.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> During the interactions and events described in this encounter, the party may notice subtle clues indicating that something could be off. While most of the monks agree with the Yokai Phoenix plan, a small minority don't. Even the dissenters, however, will not betray their fellows and will be hard to sway.</p>\n<h2>The Encounter</h2>\n<p>Neverdark is a village with a few buildings scattered about the grassy lands of this massive earth mote and a few structures—including the monastery—built into the natural walls and heights of the tall cliff face that looms over the mainland. The party can reach the village proper by following a subtle, natural trail of earth and gravel that leads from the bridge to the settlement. After allowing the characters to look around for a few moments, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>After a short walk on the much-appreciated solid ground of this enormous land mass, you can see ahead of you a beautiful field of lush grass. A stream twists through the grassland and splits near the edge of the mote, producing a few waterfalls that quickly become a soft rain above the clouds. A rainbow arcs close to a massive, multiple-level rocky hill with grass on top, and a monastery stands atop the middle platform, overlooking the village below.</blockquote>\n<p>Kayden (referred to as they/them), in the company of four other monks, approaches the party. They are dressed in spotless white robes, the edges of the sleeves depicting furious red flames. Most monks here are bald, as hair is highly flammable. In their training, the monks learn not to fear fire, but they also learn to respect it. Characters with a passive Perception 15 or higher will notice that all five monks have subtle burn scars on various parts of the body, such as their hands, feet, face, neck, etc.</p>\n<p>Kayden is older than the rest and once they reach the party, they join their palms in a greeting movement, slightly bowing while smiling. The other monks do the same. Kayden says in a tranquil voice:</p>\n<blockquote>“Brave travelers, we welcome you to our home. We apologize for any trouble or harm you may have experienced while traveling the path that led you here. We understand how Neverdark can be a difficult place to reach. I am Kayden, the spiritual leader of the Clan of the Phoenix. You are our most welcome and honored guests and you will be treated with utmost respect during your stay here. All we ask is that you return the same courtesy and agree to follow our guiding principle: ‘The strong shall respect life with unending serenity.’ Is this something you can agree with?”</blockquote>\n<p>If the party refuses, Kayden apologizes for their trouble to have come here for nothing and asks them to leave; since they have successfully reached Neverdark, the bridge is still intact for safe passage back. If they agree, Kayden accompanies them until they reach the village proper, briefly explaining the overall features of Neverdark (see below). Upon arriving at the village, Kayden says that they have business to attend to and wishes the characters a delightful stay.</p>\n<p>Since these encounters can be adapted to parties of any level, an exact number is not provided for the Neverdark population. Assume that there are some dozens of monks of various levels of experience for tier 1, and increase that number for higher tiers, possibly reaching over a hundred monks. Most teenagers and adults are @Actor[Phoenix Monk Apprentice]s, while some could be @Actor[Phoenix Monk]s, and a few are @Actor[Phoenix Firepalm]s. If the party causes any trouble at Neverdark, they'll be asked to leave. If they hurt anyone or destroy anything, the monks ask them to surrender and face the Test of Truth. Refusing to surrender results in a fight, with the majority of able monks helping to defend their own. It's a fight few parties can hope to survive.</p>\n<p>Overall, most people behave quite positively towards the party as Neverdark rarely gets visitors. Many Neverdarkans may potentially approach the characters and chat with them, asking some of the questions below, but not limited to those:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Where are you from?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How have things been below the clouds?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How was the way up?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why are you here?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What do you seek?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Locations</h2>\n<p>The main locations of Neverdark are listed below. Feel free to further enrich this village in any way you see fit. This is not meant to be a fully developed gazetteer, so the information presented here is the minimum needed to run the Sky Isles adventure. Besides the named location below, Neverdark includes rice fields to the west and some houses and other buildings in the center near the Shading Hill, as the Neverdarkans call the tall cliffs that the village hugs; other locations may be added as needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Fair of Colors]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Dotted Stables]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Taming a Winged Leopard]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Sky Grounds]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Fireborn Monastery]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Meditation Court]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Shading Hill]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[All-Seeing Towers]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Important NPCs</h2>\n<p>The population of Neverdark can be dozens to over a hundred people. You can decide the race predominance, if any, and anything about specific cultural aspects. In general, people are friendly, calm, and disciplined. Because of their training, failure is a liability. They are forgiving people when someone makes their first mistake, but can be very intolerant with repeated errors.</p>\n<h3>Kayden</h3>\n<p><em>LN, any gender/any pronouns/any humanoid race, @Actor[Master Phoenix Monk]</em></p>\n<p>Completely dedicated to their people, Kayden greatly prides themselves on the new life and home their people created. They live for the Clan and its people, having sworn to protect Neverdark with their life. No one has ever witnessed Kayden lose control over any situation, but the people are unaware of how worried Kayden is about a possible return of Sethlok.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> When Kayden recently received word of Sethlok, through rumors planted by Sethlok itself, the leader started to look for alternatives, trying to keep the information only to themselves and the two masters. Kayden had almost given up hope of finding anything to counter the threat when they discovered a book in the monastery library that mentioned the fabled Yokai Phoenix, a powerful being with flames so hot that they can kill fire elementals and melt rocks. Since then, Kayden has been obsessed with finding a way to summon this being to help the Clan, should the rumors about Sethlok's return be true. The spiritual leader of the Phoenix Monks is willing to do anything to ensure that the Clan will never be a victim of that neko yokai once again.</p>\n<h3>Aryana and Qaeth</h3>\n<p><em>LN female (she/her) and male (he/him) human, @Actor[Master Phoenix Monk]s</em></p>\n<p>These twins are Kayden's most trusted companions, the trio having a strong bond. They spend a good part of the day together and all seem to share the same opinions and ideas. Like Kayden, the twins have made the Clan their life focus. They live for the work, although they make a great effort to be with the people, their fellow companions, and interact with other Neverdarkans whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Dancing is one of Aryana's passions, and she loves to practice her dance to the sounds of her brother's lute. Qaeth greatly enjoys playing it, and the twins often perform in the moonlight, gathering many Neverdarkans who drink tea and sing and dance with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> While Qaeth agrees completely with Kayden plans and ideas, Aryana is not as convinced. She expressed her concerns once but was reprimanded by the other two, so she now keeps her different views to herself, fearing the punishment she could receive if she insists on the topic.</p>\n<h3>Threyss</h3>\n<p><em>LG male (he/they), any race, @Actor[Phoenix Firepalm]</em></p>\n<p>Threyss is Kayden's son and the responsibility and stress of being the only son of the spiritual leader weighs heavily upon him. One of the best hunters of Neverdark, Threyss enjoys reading in his free time. He's embarrassed that he failed to bring back the famed black goat to Neverdark the last time it was spotted.</p>\n<p><strong>Overarching Plot:</strong> Kayden told their son about the plan, and Threyss is anxious to prove himself after having once failed the community with the black goat.</p>\n<h2>Events</h2>\n<p>Below are some activities you can present to the party in order to give them an opportunity to learn more about the people and place.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Friendly Sparring]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[The Top of the World]</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[Welcome Party]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Outcomes</h2>\n<p>As this is a very open encounter in which the party is free to explore Neverdark on their own, the outcomes are unpredictable.</p>\n<h2>Rewards</h2>\n<p>If a character wins the @JournalEntry[Friendly Sparring] fight, award the group with XP for a hard encounter. If they reach the top of the Shading Hill (@JournalEntry[The Top of the World]), award the group with XP for a medium encounter. If they positively interact with the monks at the @JournalEntry[Welcome Party], Aryana gives them a gem worth 250 / 500 / 1,000 / 2,000 gp. Also award the group with XP for an easy encounter.</p>","img":"modules/the-sky-isles-module/journals/a-sight-for-sore-eyes/fantasy-scenes.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"F0kLzvTSBVFNjohJ":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.IX8MYZFvRh4B6TCF"},"cf":{"id":"temp_izqv1itu6lk","path":"The Sky Isles","color":"#000000"}}}
